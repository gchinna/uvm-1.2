The UVM library defines a set of base classes and utilities that facilitate
the design of modular, scalable, reusable verification environments.

The basic building blocks for all environments are components and
the transactions they use to communicate. The UVM provides base classes
for these, as shown below.

(see uvm_ref_base.gif)

- <uvm_object> - All components and transactions derive from ~uvm_object~,
  which defines an interface of core class-based operations: create, copy,
  compare, print, sprint, record, etc.  It also defines interfaces
  for instance identification (name, type name, unique id, etc.) and 
  random seeding.

- <uvm_component> - The ~uvm_component~ class is the root base class for all
  UVM components. Components are quasi-static objects that exist throughout
  simulation. This allows them to establish structural hierarchy much like
  ~modules~ and ~program blocks~. Every component is uniquely addressable via
  a hierarchical path name, e.g. "env1.pci1.master3.driver".
  The ~uvm_component~ also defines a phased test flow that components follow
  during the course of simulation. Each phase-- ~build~, ~connect~, ~run~, etc.--
  is defined by a callback that is executed in precise order. Finally,
  the ~uvm_component~ also defines configuration, reporting, transaction
  recording, and factory interfaces.

- <uvm_transaction> - The ~uvm_transaction~ is the root base class for UVM
  transactions, which, unlike ~uvm_components~, are transient in nature.
  It extends <uvm_object> to include a timing and recording
  interface. Simple transactions can derive directly from ~uvm_transaction~,
  while sequence-enabled transactions derive from ~uvm_sequence_item~.

- <uvm_root> - The ~uvm_root~ class is special ~uvm_component~ that serves
  as the top-level component for all UVM components, provides phasing 
  control for all UVM components, and other global services.
