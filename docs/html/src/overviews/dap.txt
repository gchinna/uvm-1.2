// Title: Data Access Policies
//
// The UVM provides special objects as utility classes for applying
// common policies to data access (such as 'locking' data, or ensuring
// that it remains constant after being read).
//
// This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all Data Access policies,
// and the user is encouraged to write there own, and potentially contribute them
// to the community.
