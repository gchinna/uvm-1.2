Group: Transaction Recording Classes

The recording classes provide a facility to record transactions
into a database using a consistent API.  Users can configure what
gets sent to the backend database, without knowing exactly how the
connection to that database is established.

The primary interface to the UVM recording facility is the
<uvm_recorder> class, which serves as a reference to the 
transaction in the database, as well as the policy which is used
to record information into the database.

(see uvm_ref_recording.gif)

The UVM provides a default implementation of the recording API, which
creates textual logs.  This is primarily intended to be used as an 
example of how to create a recording implementation without the user
needing to have tool and/or vendor specific code in their testbench.
